Hi, I'm Gabriel Donadel Dall'Agnol, a passionate Engineer from Brazil who loves tinkering and bringing ideas to life. Throughout my career, I've worked with multiple technologies using industry-standard patterns and architectures, helping lead medium-sized teams. 

My focus is on contributing to the React Native open-source ecosystem and making it truly universal. I believe in the power of "Write Once, Run Everywhere" and I am committed to making this philosophy a reality. Through work and dedication, we can create seamless experiences for users across different platforms and devices. I am driven by my love for creating innovative solutions and I am constantly exploring new possibilities. 

If you'd like to learn more about me and my work, you can visit my [website][1] or find me on [![LinkedIn][2.1]][2]. Let's work together to push the boundaries of what's possible with React Native!
