I'm a Software Engineer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· working at @expo, where I'm focused on contributing to the React Native open-source ecosystem and helping make cross-platform development truly universal. Throughout my career, I've worked with multiple technologies using industry-standard patterns and architectures, helping lead medium-sized teams. 
 
I believe in the power of "Write Once, Run Everywhere," and I am committed to making this philosophy a practical reality for developers. I'm driven by a love for tinkering, bringing ideas to life, and creating innovative solutions that result in seamless experiences for users across all platforms and devices. Through dedication and open collaboration, we can continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with React Native.

If you'd like to learn more about me and my work, you can visit my [website][1] or find me on [![LinkedIn][2.1]][2]. Let's work together to push the boundaries of what's possible with React Native!
